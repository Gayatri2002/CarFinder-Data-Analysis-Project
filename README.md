# CarFinder

When we need to sell our old car or buy a new one, we usually 
ask our friends, relatives, and agents for the best price,
compare prices, and analyze the  car market trend. This is a 
time-consuming and tedious process. Our website 'CarFinder' a data analysis project is 
the all-in-one solution to this problem. 

With our smart car price predictor model, you can receive the
best price for your automobile right here. You will also receive 
all of the necessary information regarding various automobile 
models. Our website has a 'cities filter' that will assist you to 
find information specific to your city. There is a clever 
Power BI sales dashboard that provides all of the information 
about the car selling market. This is a very useful feature for 
any sales team, and it distinguishes the website from other 
websites by making it beneficial for sales teams in the business.
There's also a website performance dashboard, which is 
particularly beneficial for digital marketing teams who can use it 
to gain a sense of what users are interested in.
